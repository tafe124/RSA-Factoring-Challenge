RSA Factoring Challenge HTTPS uses Secure Socket Layer to encrypt data that is transferred between client and server. SSL uses the RSA algorithm, an asymmetric encryption technology. The precise details of how the algorithm works is complex, but basically it leverages the fact that whilst multiplying two large prime numbers together is easy, factoring the result back into the constituent primes is very, very hard.In the case of you browsing the web, your browser gives the server its public key. The server uses this key to encrypt data to be sent to your browser, which then uses its private key to decrypt.
